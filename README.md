`RNA-TorsionBERT` is a DNABERT model that was pre-trained on ~4200 RNA structures before being fine-tuned on 185 non-redundant structures from rsRNASP.

It provides an improvement of MAE of 6.2Â° over the previous state-of-the-art model, SPOT-RNA-1D, on the Test Set (composed of RNA-Puzzles and CASP-RNA).
